·1t is proposed to re-buiid, on an eniarged plan, the Parish Church oi S.
hiary the virgin, Crown street, Soho, and to creet Schooiroorns oi a cor·
responding siae, as weil as e Clergy House.

«Originally built ior a congregation oi Greek Catholies under ioseph Ge-
orgirenes‚ Metropolitan oi Samos, as the inscription over the vvest door
(which nili he preserved) testities, in the senentecnth century, it was u-
sed, consecutivciy‚ hy French Protestant netugees and English Congregati-
onaiists, antii its dedication tothe purposes oi the English Chareh in
t850. .
·dithough the most has been nrade oi the buiiding (which is oi a very

mean and unattractive character) it is insuifiriont ior the accommodatiora

oi the worshippers‚ and costiy in the continual demands oi repairs: the
root, east aad west walis, together with the flooring, being in e ruinous
condition.

«The population oi the district parish is 6000, 000 the accommodatiora
provided ior them is under 400. ΤΙιο services therefore on Sandays are, in
consequence, unheaithy and inconvenientiy crowded.

·Moreover, in such a neighbourhood, a Church shouid bc seen to ad·
000030, and be impressive. tt shouid not suiier in comparisan with the
numerous gin palaces in its neighbourhood. At present the Chureh is shut
out oi sight by mean shaps and dweiiings‚ and cannot invite the passer hy
in the daria winter evening ta conae in and pray. instead oi this, it is tho
height and chcery public-house which ever iures the wanderer tn his
doom.

·nt present there are taur Schoois. Only one roonr is in any way dt ior
the purpose, and it isa ioan-to structure attached to the Choreb, aad 0ό

ι sed ior girls and iniants. The other three rooms are in diiierent parts ot
the parisii. One is the har- and pariour ota diaused public-house throne
